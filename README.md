General repository for some example Python code

# AWS

Module with Amazon Boto examples, currently including an S3 example.

Requires the boto module


	pip install boto
	

You need an AWS account, and an S3 bucket. Edit the bucket name in the main() function with a bucket in your S3 account.

I recommend Transmit for managing S3 buckets, but other choices are available.
